# Assignment1Slate2.0

The goal is designing an intuitive mobile application for courses at Sheridan College. In addition to college students who are usually between 18 to 30 years old, you should consider the continuing education courses that learners are above 45 years old and are not tech savvy.
The application is built using the following formatL
1.Shows the course list (at least 1 screen)
2.Shows an individual course screen (at least 1 screen)
3.Shows the assignment screen for a course (at least 1 screen)
4.Has a new feature that lets students in each course have a separate group chat. Show how you include it in your app (at least 2 screens)

Sheridan Course App
For chat purposes, I have used Discord as it will have different servers for each course. So, when you tap chat, it will take the user to the Discord server.
